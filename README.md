**NETWORK SECURITY DEVOPS**
- A Computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices to share information. These devices can be connected using physical wires or wirelessly.
Network DevOps is the application of DevOps principles and culture to network engineering and operations.
- Network Automation: API
- Continuous Development: Integration & Deployment

**FIREWALL**
A firewall is a security device that protects a network from outside cyber attackers. It can be hardware or software. Firewalls work by monitoring attempts to access a computer's operating system and blocking unwanted incoming traffic. 
- TYPES:
  - Packet-filtering
  - Stateful inspection
  - proxy

**PROTOCOLS**
-	Protocol refers to a set of guidelines or rules that are followed in a particular situation.
-	communication between devices or systems

**TCP MODEL**: TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
**IP MODEL**: INTERNET PROTOCOL

**OSI MODEL**: OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION 
•	OSI is a framework with 7 layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
•	TCP/IP is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the Internet.

**OSI Vs TCP**
- TCP/IP is a practical model that addresses specific communication challenges and relies on standardized protocols.
- OSI serves as a protocol-independent framework designed to encompass various network communication methods.
