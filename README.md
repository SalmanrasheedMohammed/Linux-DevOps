**LINUX**
- LINUX - Lovable Intellect Not Using XP
**Linux** is an open-source Unix-like operating system kernel initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It serves as the foundation for various operating systems, known as Linux distributions.
- Kernel: The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system
- Distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and Arch Linux.
- Terminal and Shell: Linux is known for its command-line interface (CLI)
- Root: [/] It was a root directory
  
**Kernel**: [CORE]
- The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it.

**CLI**: Command Line Interface (BASH)
- CLI is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer. CLIs are also known as console user interfaces, command-line user interfaces, and character user interfaces. 
- EX: ls -l

**SHELL** (BASH Script)
- Writing a series of commands in a file (shell script) to be executed by the shell. This is often used for automation or repetitive tasks.
- EX: echo "Hello, World!"

**LINUX ARCHITECTURE**

- The Linux architecture is highly modular and configurable, offering a high degree of customization and flexibility to users and developers.

**- NOTE:**
  - Windows: It consists of C/D/E drives
  - Linux: It consists of (/) slash
  - Bash: Bourne again shell
  - GNU: GNU’s not Unix
  - 
**Linux Distributions**
- Ubuntu
- CentOS
- Debian
- Linux Mint
- Red Hat

**NETWORK SECURITY DEVOPS**
- A Computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices to share information. These devices can be connected using physical wires or wirelessly.
Network DevOps is the application of DevOps principles and culture to network engineering and operations.
- Network Automation: API
- Continuous Development: Integration & Deployment

**FIREWALL**
A firewall is a security device that protects a network from outside cyber attackers. It can be hardware or software. Firewalls work by monitoring attempts to access a computer's operating system and blocking unwanted incoming traffic. 
- TYPES:
  - Packet-filtering
  - Stateful inspection
  - proxy

**PROTOCOLS**
-	Protocol refers to a set of guidelines or rules that are followed in a particular situation.
-	communication between devices or systems

**TCP MODEL**: TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
**IP MODEL**: INTERNET PROTOCOL

**OSI MODEL**: OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION 
•	OSI is a framework with 7 layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
•	TCP/IP is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the Internet.

**OSI Vs TCP**
- TCP/IP is a practical model that addresses specific communication challenges and relies on standardized protocols.
- OSI serves as a protocol-independent framework designed to encompass various network communication methods.
